# Crowd Funding

-   The admin sets a monetary goal and deadline for the campaign.
-   Contributors can contribute to the campaign by sending ETH.
-   The admin creates a spending request to spend money from the campaign.
-   Contributors vote on the spending request.
-   If more than 50% of the contributors vote in favor of the request, the admin is allowed to spend the specified amount.
-   The power to make decisions about how the funds are used is transferred from the administrator to the contributors.
-   If the campaign does not reach its monetary goal within the deadline, contributors can request a refund.
